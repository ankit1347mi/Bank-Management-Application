# Bank-Management-Application

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a 
bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic 
functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial 
applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end 
banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also, to enable the userâ€™s 
work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional 
banking project. 

The Bank Account Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant 
technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management 
System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is 
not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is 
developed using Java language. Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT, 
systems and product development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage 
a contractual relationship. Organization need to effectively define and manage requirements to 
ensure they are meeting needs of the customer, while proving compliance and staying on the 
schedule and within budget.
